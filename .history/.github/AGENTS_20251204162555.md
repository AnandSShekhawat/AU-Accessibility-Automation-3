## Setup

- This repo is a training AU site used to demonstrate automated accessibility remediation.
- Install tools:
  - Node 20+ if needed
- Accessibility scan:
  - Axe CLI report is generated at `a11y-report.json` by the `Automated Accessibility Scan` workflow.
- Main page under test:
  - `before.html` and `before-menu.css`

## Task: Fix accessibility issues reported by the scanner

When you are asked to fix accessibility issues:

1. Read `a11y-report.json` to understand violations.
2. Focus on fixing `before.html` and `before-menu.css`.
3. For each fix, ensure:
   - Proper semantics and ARIA.
   - Keyboard access and focus visibility.
   - Contrast / color usage meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
4. Run any available checks (for example rerun axe locally, if possible).
5. Create a new branch named `copilot/a11y-fixes-<short-id>`.
6. Open a pull request with:
   - Summary of issues fixed.
   - Link back to the original issue(s).
7. Do **not** merge the PR. Wait for a human review.

## Browser Tooling Policy

Do not install Chrome, Chromedriver, or other external browser dependencies.
Fix accessibility issues directly using code changes.
